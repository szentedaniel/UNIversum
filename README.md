## Abstract

The aim of my Thesis is the creation of a simple Monopoly-like game, in which,
at most four players can play at a time with each other, while also having the ability
to create lobbies, where they can invite one another.

The implementation was made by web technologies. The backend is provided by
an Express server, using a Node.js engine. The communication takes place through
websockets, via a module named Socket.io.
The frontend is the most popular JavaScript library nowadays called React JS.

The game is displayed in an izometric view, this way, it is easier to view and more
transparent. Also, in most cases, players prefer this view in such games. The
graphics elements are rendered by a HTML5 Creation Engine called PixiJS.
Regarding the visuals of the game, it was made in modern and clean design, which
has gained plenty of popularity recently, and boasting an ever-growing playerbase.
